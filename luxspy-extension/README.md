# LuxSpy Chrome Extension

A Chrome extension that monitors and analyzes DOM events on AutoDarts match pages (`https://play.autodarts.io/matches/:match_uuid`).

## Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors DOM changes on AutoDarts match pages
- **Event Detection**: Tracks player names, game states, and navigation status
- **Smart Focus Logic**: Automatically determines LED colors based on logged-in player presence
- **Server Communication**: Sends events to Go server for LED control
- **Status Popup**: Shows current monitoring status and server configuration
- **Console Logging**: Logs all detected events to the browser console
- **State Testing**: Built-in UI controls for testing board states
- **Settings Management**: Configurable server URL and connection settings

## Monitored Elements

The extension monitors these DOM elements:

1. **Current Player**: `.ad-ext-player-active *> .ad-ext-player-name`
2. **Game State**: 
   - `div.css-aiihgx` â†’ "ready"
   - `div.css-3nk254` â†’ "takeout" 
   - Neither present â†’ "idle"
3. **Navigation Status**: Checks if current player matches `.navigation *> img` alt text

## Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `luxspy-extension` folder
5. The extension will appear in your extensions list

## Usage

1. Navigate to any AutoDarts page: `https://play.autodarts.io/*`
2. The extension will automatically start monitoring
3. **On Match Pages**: Watch the LED strip change colors based on game state:
   - **Green**: Focused player is ready to throw
   - **Purple**: Unfocused player is ready to throw
   - **Yellow**: Someone needs to take out
   - **Off**: Waiting for next turn
4. **On Other Pages**: The extension tracks the logged-in player but doesn't control LEDs
5. Click the extension icon to view current status and configure server settings
