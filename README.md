# LuxSpy

A comprehensive monitoring system for AutoDarts match pages that combines a Chrome extension for real-time DOM event monitoring and a Go server for LED strip control based on game states.

## Overview

LuxSpy is designed to monitor and analyze DOM events on AutoDarts pages (`https://play.autodarts.io/*`) and provide real-time visual feedback through LED strip control. The system consists of two main components:

- **Chrome Extension** (`luxspy-extension/`): Monitors DOM changes in real-time and detects player states
- **Go Server** (`luxspy-server/`): Processes events and controls RGB LED strips via TCP protocol

## ðŸš€ **CI/CD Pipeline**

This project includes automated CI/CD workflows:

- **Docker Build & Push**: Automatically builds and pushes the Go server Docker image to GitHub Container Registry (GHCR) on main branch pushes
- **Chrome Extension Publishing**: Automatically builds and publishes the Chrome extension to the Chrome Web Store on main branch pushes
- **Version Management**: Rolling versioning with automatic patch increments for the server, manual versioning for the extension

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ **Real-time Game State Monitoring**
- Monitors AutoDarts pages automatically (match pages and general site)
- Detects player names, game states, and navigation status
- Identifies which player is currently active (Player 1 or Player 2)
- Always tracks logged-in player from any AutoDarts page

### ðŸŽ¨ **Smart LED Control**
- **Focused Player Ready** â†’ ðŸŸ¢ Green LED (logged-in player or first player in watch mode)
- **Unfocused Player Ready** â†’ ðŸŸ£ Purple LED (other player or second player in watch mode)
- **Takeout Required** â†’ ðŸŸ¡ Yellow LED
- **Idle State** â†’ âš« LED Off
- **Error State** â†’ ðŸ”´ Red LED

### ðŸŽ¯ **Smart Focus Control**
- **If logged-in player is in the match**: They get green color, other player gets purple
- **If logged-in player is not in the match (watch mode)**: First player gets green, second player gets purple
- **Consistent colors throughout the match**, even when players switch sides

### ðŸ”§ **Smart Integration**
- Automatic event detection and LED control
- Real-time popup status updates
- Manual LED control via API
- Health monitoring and debugging tools
- Background script handles HTTP requests to avoid mixed content issues
- **State Testing**: Built-in test endpoints and UI controls for testing board states
- **Version Information**: API endpoint to check server version and build information

## Chrome Extension (`luxspy-extension/`)

### Features

- **Real-time Monitoring**: Continuously monitors DOM changes on AutoDarts match pages
- **Player Detection**: Identifies current player and their position (Player 1/2)
- **Event Detection**: Tracks player names, game states, and navigation status
- **Server Communication**: Sends events to Go server for LED control
- **Live Popup Updates**: Real-time status display with visual feedback
- **Smart Targeting**: Only activates on AutoDarts match pages

### Monitored Elements

The extension monitors these DOM elements:

1. **Current Player**: `.ad-ext-player-active *> .ad-ext-player-name` (match pages only)
2. **Player Number**: Determined by position in player list (match pages only)
3. **Game State**: 
   - `div.css-aiihgx` â†’ "ready" (match pages only)
   - `div.css-3nk254` â†’ "takeout" (match pages only)
   - Neither present â†’ "idle"
4. **Logged-in Player**: `.navigation *> img` alt text (all AutoDarts pages)
5. **Focus Control**: Automatic focus based on logged-in player presence in match

### Installation

1. Clone this repository
2. Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
3. Enable "Developer mode" in the top right
4. Click "Load unpacked" and select the `luxspy-extension` folder
5. The extension will appear in your extensions list

### Usage

1. Navigate to any AutoDarts page: `https://play.autodarts.io/*`
2. The extension will automatically start monitoring
3. **On Match Pages**: Watch the LED strip change colors based on game state:
   - **Green**: Focused player is ready to throw
   - **Purple**: Unfocused player is ready to throw
   - **Yellow**: Someone needs to take out
   - **Off**: Waiting for next turn
4. **On Other Pages**: The extension tracks the logged-in player but doesn't control LEDs
5. Click the extension icon to view current status and server configuration

## Go Server (`luxspy-server/`)

### Features

- **HTTP Web Server**: Listens for events from Chrome extension
- **LED Strip Control**: Controls RGB LED strips via TCP protocol

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **CORS Errors**: Ensure the Go server is running and CORS is properly configured
2. **LED Connection**: Verify LED strip IP address and network connectivity
3. **Extension Not Working**: Check if the page is an AutoDarts match page
4. **Server Won't Start**: Check if port is already in use
5. **Mixed Content Errors**: The extension uses background scripts to handle HTTP requests, avoiding mixed content issues on HTTPS pages

### LED Protocol

The server communicates with LED strips using TCP protocol:

| Command | Bytes (before checksum) | Description |
|---------|------------------------|-------------|
| Turn on | `0x71 0x23 0x0f` | Turn on LED strip |
| Turn off | `0x71 0x24 0x0f` | Turn off LED strip |
| Set RGB | `0x31 R G B 0x00 0x0f 0x0f` | Set RGB color |
| Query | `0x81 0x8a 0x8b` | Query status |
